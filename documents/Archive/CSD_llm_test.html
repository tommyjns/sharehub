            <li>Start with Level 1 to verify basic retrieval capability</li>
            <li>Use Levels 2-3 for general LLM evaluation</li>
            <li>Levels 4-5 can distinguish between good and excellent models</li>
            <li>Check for hallucination - some LLMs might invent rules that don't exist</li>
            <li>Verify citation accuracy - good LLMs should reference specific rule numbers</li>
